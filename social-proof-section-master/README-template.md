## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

clip-path

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
header::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    background-color: var(--light-grayish-magenta);
    width: 375px;
    height: 350px;
    z-index: -1;
    clip-path: circle(65.8% at 37% 1%);
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

- [Clippy - Clip Path Generator](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) - This tool let me draw the circle and move the radius and edge to position it the way I wanted. This came in very handy because I was too confused by the clip-path property to use it on my own this time.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
